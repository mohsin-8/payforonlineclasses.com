                    <p>We have had a very positive experience with Payforonlneclasses Tutors. Our son has really improved her grades, which has given her confidence in the class. Gaining confidence in class usually translates to confidence outside the classroom environment, and touches other aspects of your life. It also helps knowing that as you move on to harder material, your foundation is strong. This helps to prepare her for college. She felt very comfortable with her tutor.</p>

                    <p>I would like to acknowledge an outstanding tutor that I recently had for my Calculus 2 class. Jenna did an amazing job tutoring me and preparing me for the final exam that I had. I was failing this class and did not understand a thing learned within the course and she managed to teach me the whole class within just nine sessions. She was able to break down and simplify the concepts in order for me to understand such a hard subject</p>

                    <p>I have to tell you how much our family loves Jason, our tutor. He is so dedicated and hard-working. His teaching abilities are impressive and he demonstrated an acute understanding of our kids, not only as students, but as individuals. He set high expectations for the kids and knew exactly what support they needed to meet them. We have a deep respect for Jason and are so grateful to have had his services this summer."</p>
